The following scripts are a part of this project:

MultipleRandomWalks_1D.py : Simulates several particals performing a one dimensional random walk. The results allow us to visualise the diffusion over time in random walks.

freeRandomWalk_2d.py : Simulates a 2 dimensional random walk over time for a single partical.
