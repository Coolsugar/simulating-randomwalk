The following scripts are a part of this project:

-> MultipleRandomWalks_1D.py : Simulates several particals performing a one dimensional random walk. The results allow us to visualise the diffusion over time in random walks. 
We observe that over time, the elements diffuse further apart, giving us a Gaussian distribution. 

-> freeRandomWalk_2D.py : Simulates a 2 dimensional random walk over time for a single partical. 

-> Multiple_freeRandomWalk_2D_collisionsDetect.py : Simulates several independent random walks over time in a 2D plane. All collisions between elements are logged. No collision phyics.





-> CollisionFrequency.py : Allows us to interpret collision log data. We may see that the number of collisions decrease as elements diffuse over time.
We observe that the number of collisions decrease exponentially as elements diffuse over time.
